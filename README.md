Demo: [MuziqueHub](https://project-3-music-app.herokuapp.com).

## About üìñ

## How it Works üî®
1. On the Home page, users will be presented with ablilty to search for an artist. 

2. The resulting data will include the artist's biography, links to social media, photos, and videos.

3. Once account is created, the user will be granted the ability to save search results to the Favorites page 

4. On the Concerts page, the user can search separately for live performance information by searching for an artist.

The `Game.js` component contains a majority of the applications core functionality.

A method for shuffling an array of image URLS is created here and called in the initial state of the component.
```
shuffleArray() {
    // Create copy of current array to modify by value
    const newArr = images.slice();
    // Create new array to store shuffled data
    const shuffledArr = [];
    // Loop thru newArr and get random index based on current length then splice val from newArr and push to shuffledArr
    while (newArr.length > 0) {
        shuffledArr.push(newArr.splice(Math.floor(Math.random() * newArr.length), 1)[0]);
    }
    return shuffledArr;
}
```

The current *this* is bound to the *checkClicked* method and then called in a click event that is attached to each image.
```
checkClicked(guess) {
    // Create copy of wasClicked array to modify by value
    const prevState = this.state.wasClicked.slice();
    // Shuffle images
    const shuffle = this.shuffleArray();
    // Track score
    let score = this.state.score;
    let highScore = this.state.highScore;
    // If user guess is not found in wasClicked
    if (!this.state.wasClicked.includes(guess)) {
        // Store clicked items
        prevState.push(guess);
        // Handle score
        if(score === highScore) {
            score ++;
            highScore++;
        } else {
            score++;
        }
        // Hanlde correct state
        this.setState({
            score: score,
            highScore: highScore,
            navMessage: "Correct",
            navMsgColor: "success",
            allCharacters: shuffle,
            wasClicked: prevState,
            shake: false,
        });
        return setTimeout(() => this.setState({ navMsgColor: "" }), 500);
    }
    // If user guess is found in wasClicked
    if (this.state.wasClicked.includes(guess)) {
        // Hanlde score
        let score = 0;
        // Handle incorrect state
        this.setState({
            score: score,
            highScore: highScore,
            navMessage: "Incorrect",
            navMsgColor: "fail",
            allCharacters: shuffle,
            wasClicked: [],
            shake: true,
            flip: true
        });
        return setTimeout(() => this.setState({ navMsgColor: "", flip: false }), 500)
    }
}
```
